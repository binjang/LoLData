# League of Legends Data Analysis

This was a 3-month school project for "Introduction to Data Science" class on Spring 2021 Semester. 

'Final Submission.ipynb' contains the final submission of the project.

'Data Collection Code.ipynb' contains the code that I used to create the datasets using Riot Games developer API and preprocess it.

Other files are the actual datasets that I used for the data analysis part I and II.
